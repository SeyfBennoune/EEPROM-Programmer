# 1. Overview   
  
  This project was part of the Z80 computer project (found in "Z80Computer" repo), where this EEPROM programmer was used intensively in programming that project's EEPROM chips.   
  This project is continuously enhanced whenever possible.  
     
# 2. History and Future enhancement   
   
  ## 2.1 History
  * First, Arduino Uno was used to build the first prototype for this project.  
  * Arduino Uno was replaced later with Arduino Nano for the sake of minimising dimensions.  
  * For GUI, Arduino IDE's serial monitor was used to communicate serially with the device.
  * A C program is built using gtk UI elements provided.
  ## 2.2 What's next?
  * Replacing arduino dev board with a microcontroller chip as a chalenge where the level of abstraction is lowered.  
  * Building a GUI using Flutter framework as a learning project.
